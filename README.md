Ruby Developer Application Test for SMART PENSIONS

### Task

```
Graduate Developer Test

Before you start coding (and let’s be honest, we know that’s what you want to do), please read the following.

The test is for us to see how you code and the methodologies you use, what we will be looking for in this test are the following:

● Functionality ● Efficiency – We like clean, simple code. ● Readability ● Tests (we have 96% test coverage in our code and we aim to keep it that way). ● Also, we would like to understand your ability to use TDD and OO, so please ensure these are part of your complete test. ● Feel free to submit your solution as a link to your source control repository

The role is working as a Ruby Engineer, but if you don’t have Ruby experience, don’t panic! Submit your solution in whatever language you are most proficient in.

The test is as follows:


1. Write a program that:

a. Receives a log file as an argument (webserver.log is provided) e.g.: ./<parse> webserver.log

b. Returns the following:

> list of webpages with most page views ordered from most pages views to less page views e.g.: /home 90 visits /index 80 visits etc...

> list of webpages with most unique page views also ordered e.g.: /about/2 8 unique views /index 5 unique views etc...


Finally, have some fun – Feel free to make changes or design something if you think it meets the criteria above, but would produce better outcomes and of course, the sooner you return the test, the quicker we can move the process.
